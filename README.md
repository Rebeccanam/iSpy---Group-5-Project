This README will walk you through how to install and run our app

First, make sure that you have NodeJS installed on your system.
If it is not installed, you can install it from: https://nodejs.org/en/ and installing the LTS version.

Once you have node installed, download the all of the files from this github.

Then, in a terminal, go to the project directory and run the following commands:

npm install --force

npm start

npm install downloads all of the node_modules you will need to run the project and npm start will start running the app and open a window in your web browser.

If a window does not open automatically, you can access the project in any web browser at localhost:3000 assuming that port is open.
